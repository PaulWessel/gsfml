.SH NAME
fzinformer \- Plot along-FZ statistical information
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(fzinformer) [ OPT(D) ] [ OPT(F)IT(max) ] [ OPT(I)IT(profile) ] [ OPT(N)IT(max) ] 
[ OPT(S)IT(max) ] [ OPT(T)IT(prefix) ] [ OPT(W)IT(max) ] [ OPT(V) ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(fzinformer) is a script developed as part of the Global Seafloor Fabric
and Magnetic Lineation Project [see www.soest.hawaii.edu/PT/GSFML for a full
description of the project].  It make plots of statistical information obtained
by BD(gmt fzanalyzer) as a function of position along a fracture zone (FZ).
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
OPT(D)
Use the filtered output from BD(gmt fzblender) instead of the raw analysis file in making
the plot.  This requires that you ran BD(gmt fzblender) with the OPT(D) option.
.TP
OPT(F)IT(max)
Sets the maximum F-statistic amplitude for the plot [10000].  A logarithmic
scale is used for this panel; all others are linear.
.TP
OPT(I)IT(profile)
By default we plot all the cross-profiles in one stack.  To select a single
profile only, append the running number of the profile, where 0 is the first profile.
.TP
OPT(N)IT(max)
Sets the maximum range of VGG amplitudes (in Eotvos) for the plot [200].
.TP
OPT(S)IT(max)
Sets the maximum (+/-) half-range of FZ offsets (in km) [25].
.TP
OPT(T)IT(prefix)
Sets the file name prefix used when running BD(gmt fzanalyzer) and BD(gmt fzblender)
[The default is fztrack].  The files used here are IT(prefix)_analysis.txt
(or IT(prefix)_filtered.txt if OPT(D) is used) and IT(prefix)_blend.txt.
.TP
OPT(W)IT(max)
Sets the maximum range of FZ widths (in km) [50].
.TP
OPT(V)
Reports plotting progress [quiet].
.SH PLOT FEATURES
BD(fzinformer) packs much information into each plot by using different symbols and
colors.  Empirical information obtained from raw data are shown in red.  Information
derived from a forced trough FZ model are shown in green, while the information derived
from the optimal blend model are shown in blue.  We present 7 panels for each FZ. Panel
1 (top) shows how the F-statistic parameter varies with distance for the trough (green)
and blend (blue) models. Panel 2 shows the reduction in variance for the same two models.
Panel 3 shows the maximum amplitude for the two models and the empirical data (red).
Panel 4 shows the width of the FZ signal for all three data.  Panel 5 presents the offset
(in km) between the digitized trace and the optimal FZ locations (one curve for each type).
Panel 6 shows which side (left is -1, right = +1) is the young side assuming a Pacific edge-anomaly model (it will tend
to jump back and forth where the signal is close to symmetric and should only be used when
we have clearly asymmetric signals). Finally, panel 7 shows
the compression parameter C for the blend and trough models, as well as the blend parameter A
(black line) for the optimal blend model.
.SH EXAMPLES
To look at the statistics for the 5th (0 is first) FZ analyzed as part of a larger group called traces,
accepting default values except we override the maximum amplitude by using 100,
