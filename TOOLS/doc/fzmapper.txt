.SH NAME
fzmapper \- Make Mercator map of FZ traces and cross-profiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(fzmapper) [ OPT(A) ] [ OPT(F)IT(origfile) ] [ OPT(G)IT(img) ] [ OPT(L)IT(labelint) ] 
[ OPT(O) ] [ OPT(S) ] [ OPT(T)IT(prefix) ] [ OPT(W)IT(width)[BD(c)|BD(i)] ] [ OPT(V) ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(fzmapper) is a Bash script developed as part of the Global Seafloor Fabric
and Magnetic Lineation Project [see www.soest.hawaii.edu/PT/GSFML for a full
description of the project].  It make a Mercator map of cross-profiles from the
processed fracture zone (FZ) traces and cross-profiles as
produced by BD(gmt grdtrack).  Optionally, overlay analysis and blend results.
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
OPT(A)
In addition to the resampled FZ trace and the cross-profiles, overlay the
result of BD(gmt fzanalyzer) as color-coded points (red for data, green for trough,
and blue for blend model) [No model results].
.TP
OPT(F)IT(origfile)
This is the original digitized FZ traces that was given as input to BD(grdtrack).
.TP
OPT(G)IT(img)
Optionally, supply the name of the VGG img file to use as background [curv.16.1.img].
.TP
OPT(L)IT(labelint)
Determines how often we annotate the cross profiles.  An IT(labelint) of 1 will
annotate every profile, IT(labelint) = 3 will do every 3rd profile, etc.
.TP
OPT(O)
Instead of making a stand-alone PDF plot, write a PostScript overlay to stdout,
i.e., make the plot using the GMT -O -K options.
.TP
OPT(S)
Overlay the smoothed FZ trace produced by BD(gmt fzblender) [no overlay]. 
.TP
OPT(T)IT(prefix)
Sets the file name prefix used for all input files as produced by
BD(gmt fzanalyzer).  The default is fztrack.  The files are IT(prefix)_cross.txt and 
IT(prefix)_par.txt as well as the resampled output from BD(gmt grdtrack) which
should be called IT(prefix)_resampled.txt.  When OPT(S) is set we also look for IT(prefix)_blend.txt
as produced by BD(gmt fzblender), and with OPT(A) we also look for IT(prefix)_analysis.txt.
.TP
OPT(W)IT(width)[BD(c)|BD(i)]
Sets the width of the Mercator map.  Unless the measure unit BD(i)(nch)
or BD(c)(m) is appended the unit is assumed to be whatever the GMT default
BD(PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT) is currently set to.
.TP
OPT(V)
Reports plotting progress [quiet].
.SH EXAMPLES
To look at the cross-profiles and the best-fit models and optimal FZ locations in
map view, with the prefix used previously as "traces", using a 9 inch wide Mercator,
and only label every other profile, try
.br
.sp
fzmapper -Ttraces -W9i -L2 -Fguides.xy -S -V -A
.br
.sp
where we use the original digitized FZ locations guides.xy, choosing to annotate every
other profile.  The final map will be named IT(prefix)_map.pdf.  For cross-section
profiles, see BD(fzprofiler).
