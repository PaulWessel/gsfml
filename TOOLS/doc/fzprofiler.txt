.SH NAME
fzprofiler \- Plot one or all FZ cross-profiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
BD(fzprofiler) [ OPT(H)IT(height)[BD(c)|BD(i)] ] 
[ OPT(I)IT(profile) ] [ OPT(L)IT(inc) ] [ OPT(N)IT(ncols) ] [ OPT(T)IT(prefix) ] [ OPT(V) ] [ OPT(W)IT(width)[BD(c)|BD(i)] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BD(fzprofiler) is a script developed as part of the Global Seafloor Fabric
and Magnetic Lineation Project [see www.soest.hawaii.edu/PT/GSFML for a full
description of the project].  It plots the cross-profiles and the information produced by BD(gmt fzanalyzer).
All plots are combined into one plot using
whatever custom page size is needed to fit the individual plots given
their specifications.
.SH OPTIONS
No space between the option flag and the associated arguments.
.TP
OPT(H)IT(height)[BD(c)|BD(i)]
Sets the plot height of an individual profile.  Unless the measure unit BD(i)(nch)
or BD(c)(m) is appended the unit is assumed to be whatever the GMT default
BD(PROJ_LENGTH_UNIT) is currently set to.
.TP
OPT(I)IT(profile)
By default we plot all the cross-profiles in one stack.  To select a single
profile only, append the running number of the profile, where 0 is the first profile.
.TP
OPT(L)IT(inc)
Determines which profiles to plot.  By default we plot every profile (IT(in) = 1).
Use OPT(L) to plot every IT(inc) profile instead [1].
.TP
OPT(N)IT(ncols)
Spread profiles across IT(ncols) columns.  If IT(ncols) = 1
then all profiles are stacked vertically in one long panel; if IT(ncols) = 2
then we split the profiles evenly between two columns, etc.
.TP
OPT(T)IT(prefix)
Sets the file name prefix used for all input files as produced by
BD(gmt fzanalyzer).  The default is fztrack. The files are IT(prefix)_cross.txt, IT(prefix)_analysis.txt,
IT(prefix)_par.txt as well as the resampled output from BD(gmt grdtrack) which
should be called IT(prefix)_resampled.txt.
.TP
OPT(W)IT(width)[BD(c)|BD(i)]
Similarly sets the plot width of an individual profile.  For units, see OPT(H)IT(height).
.TP
OPT(V)
Reports plotting progress [quiet].
.SH PLOT FEATURES
BD(fzprofiler) packs much information into each plot by using different symbols and
colors.  The cross-profile VGG data are plotted as red circles connected by a faint
red dotted line.  The central corridor set with BD(gmt fzanalyzer) OPT(D) is shown in light
blue.  Black line is the best symmetric
trough model; inverted triangle indicates the best location of the FZ (trough) and
its error bars reflect the half-width.  Blue line is the best asymmetric blend model;
circle shows the best location of the maximum VGG slope.  Finally, the inverted
red triangle and half-width error bar shows the best empirical trough location.  Dashed
orange line shows the crustal age variations.  Profile orientation is
indicated by the W-E or S-N letters, with vertical scale shown on the left (VGG) and
right (age).  Finally, each panel prints the best blend parameters.
.SH EXAMPLES
To look at the cross-profiles and the best-fit models and optimal FZ locations on
a per-profiles basis, with the prefix used previously as "traces", and placing the
profiles into two columns, each 6 inches wide with individual plots 2 inches tall,
try
.br
.sp
fzprofiler -Ttraces -W6i -H2i -N2 -V
.br
.sp
The final plot will be named IT(prefix)_cross.pdf.  To see the same profiles in map
view, use BD(fzmapper).  To plot a synthetic profile, see BD(fzmodeler).
